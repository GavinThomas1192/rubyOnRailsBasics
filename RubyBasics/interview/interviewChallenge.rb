# 1. Write a Ruby method that prints numbers from 1 to 100; except for multiples of three print "Trak", multiples of five print "Star", and multiples of both three and five print "Trakstar". 

# 2. Write a Ruby method that determines if two words are anagrams of each other.  I look forward to seeing what you come up with!
